## Patents

### [US Patent 9912757](https://patents.google.com/patent/US9912757B2/en)

#### Correlation Identity Generation Method for Cloud Environment. Mar, 2018
Inventors: *Ashok Anand, Gowri Shankar, Giribabu Yerradla*

This invention relates to a method for generating correlation identity with respect to a client to establish , integrate and communicate to a server within a cloud environment ( e . g . InswitTM Cloud ) . A service location identity can be generated with respect to a remote client by getting at least one service node of an appropriate service request made by the client device within the cluster of the cloud environment. 

A correlation ID / source ID can be thereafter generated based on the service location identity to serialize the payload and establish a connection with the server . The integration services with respect to the client device can be instantiated to permit authenticated information flow within the cloud network . The messages including the information on the destination end points can be finally emanated out of the source end points to the destination end point by efficiently authenticating the client devices using the correlation ID .

### [US Patent 10084863B2](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10084863B2/en)

#### Electronic switching system for generating correlation identity. Sep, 2018
Inventors: *Gowri Shankar, Giribabu Yerradla*

An electronic switching system for generating correlation identify (ID) with respect to a client in order to thereby establish, integrate and communicate to a server (lean server or nano server) within a cloud environment (e.g. Inswitâ„¢ Cloud). A service location identification module for identifying and generating a service location identity with respect to a remote client. A source ID generating module for generating a correlation ID/source ID based on the service location identify in order to serialize the payload and establish a connection with the server. 

The electronic switching system proposed herein operates external to the cloud environment by effectively generating the correlation identity with respect to a client device accessing the server in a cloud environment. The system also switches, integrates and executes client communications to an appropriate server in the cloud environment using the correlation ID.
